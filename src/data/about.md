### Intro

Hi, my name is Kale-ab. I am a computer scientist working as a Machine Learning Engineer by day and a Machine Learning Researcher by night. I am interested in using my toolbox of programming, machine learning knowledge and analytical skills to solve really difficult problems. These problems can be theoretical - theory of deep learning or practical - problems related to social good and that have a positive impact on people's lives.
