### About

I am a Research Engineer based in Johannesburg, South Africa. I am interested in using Machine learning, specifically Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning to solve challenging problems. These problems can be theoretical or practical in nature. I use my toolbox of programming, machine learning, statistics, and probability to solve these problems. I am also passionate about technology and how it can help the African continent.
